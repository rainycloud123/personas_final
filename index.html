                Summary:
            </h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Users used vending machines when desperate for quick and convenient snacks (so often in a hurry),
                    not for pleasure.
                    They go into the process expecting smooth transactions and easy use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User expressed benefits of vending machine use include getting a quick snack, avoiding human
                    interaction and avoiding human error on the seller side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User expressed drawbacks include price, lack of choices/unhealthy choices, machine failure
                    (especially important), difficulty paying (related to machine function), snacks getting stuck
                    (related to machine function), and placement of machines targeting those who will fall for drawbacks
                    (such as schools and workplaces with limited other food options).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Userâ€™s main frustrations included lack of interface accessibility, when payment doesn't work
                    (malfunction), when a snack gets stuck (malfunction), and when the machine is not well kept so
                    snacks inside appear older.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users felt that machines could be improved with more food choice and price decreases but also as it
                    relates to the interface itself, machines could be improved with increased accessibility,
                    reliability, and a more straightforward/consistent order of performing tasks across all vending
                    machines.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Problem: Trying to get snacks to people conveniently and quickly without the need of a human/in-person
                vendor.
                Key components:
                Keypad: where you can type the number of associated snacks and either select it or find
                out its price.
                Payment box: where you can swipe/tap your card. (also have a cash insert in a more
                detailed sketch).
                Screen (with check mark): Shows current state of transaction.
                Pickup compartment: Where you push in to get your snack which is designed in such a way that you cannot
                reach your hand up to steal the snack.
